# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

I made a dessert store because I love to eat desserts and sweets so I decided to use my favorite desserts in my code. I used a superclass called desserts and 2 subclasses, pastry and cake. They each used a toString to return values and text in the console. My code includes comments that describe which segment is. I also used set and get methods to display different values of pieces. The toString utilixed every single object.
